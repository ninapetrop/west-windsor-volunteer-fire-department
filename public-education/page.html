                    <p>
                    Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can be deadly. It is produced 
                    whenever fuels such as gas, oil, wood, or charcoal are burned. Common household appliances, like 
                    furnaces, stoves, water heaters, and fireplaces, can produce CO if not properly maintained or ventilated.

                    <p>
                        Without a carbon monoxide detector, you may never know when dangerous levels of this gas are present 
                        in your home. Prolonged exposure to CO can lead to symptoms like headaches, dizziness, confusion, and 
                        even death. As firefighters, we often see tragedies that could have been prevented with the simple 
                        installation of a CO detector.

                        <li>Replace the entire unit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, usually every 5–7 years.</li>

                        Carbon monoxide detectors are one of the most affordable and effective tools for keeping your family safe 
                        from CO poisoning. As firefighters, our goal is to help prevent emergencies before they happen. Installing 
                        and maintaining CO detectors can save lives and give you peace of mind. Protect your loved ones—don’t wait 
                        until it’s too late.

                    <p>
                        A warm fire in the hearth or the steady heat from a woodstove can make a home feel cozy, especially 
                        during colder months. However, if not properly maintained, chimneys and woodstoves can pose serious 
                        fire and carbon monoxide risks. As firefighters, we know that most chimney fires and related incidents 
                        are preventable with proper care and attention.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Have your chimney and woodstove inspected by a certified 
                            professional at least once a year. Inspections can identify damage, blockages, or creosote buildup 
                            that could lead to a fire.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Keep It Clean:</strong> Chimneys should be cleaned annually or more often if you use your 
                            fireplace or woodstove frequently. Creosote, a byproduct of burning wood, is highly flammable and 
                            a leading cause of chimney fires.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Burn Properly:</strong> Only burn seasoned, dry wood to reduce creosote buildup. Avoid 
                            burning green wood, paper, or trash, as these materials can produce excess smoke and deposits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use a Screen or Glass Doors:</strong> If you have an open fireplace, use a screen or glass 
                            doors to keep sparks and embers from escaping into your home.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Check Your Chimney Cap:</strong> Ensure the chimney cap is in place and in good condition. 
                            A cap helps keep debris, animals, and moisture out of the chimney.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Install Smoke and CO Detectors:</strong> Place detectors near your fireplace or woodstove 
                            and on every level of your home. Test them regularly to ensure they are functioning properly.
                        </li>

                        ventilation. If you hear loud cracking or popping sounds while using your fireplace, it could indicate 
                        a chimney fire—exit your home immediately and call emergency services.

                  <p>
                    Firepits are a great way to enjoy the outdoors, but during brushfire season, they can become a serious 
                    hazard. Dry vegetation, high winds, and hot embers can quickly turn a relaxing evening into a dangerous 
                    wildfire. As firefighters, we urge everyone to prioritize safety when using firepits in high-risk seasons.
                </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Check Local Regulations:</strong> Always confirm firepit use is allowed in your area during 
                          brushfire season. Some regions may issue bans or restrictions to reduce wildfire risks.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Choose the Right Location:</strong> Place your firepit at least 10 feet away from buildings, 
                          trees, or anything flammable. Ensure the area around the firepit is clear of dry grass, leaves, or debris.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Use a Screen:</strong> Cover your firepit with a spark screen to prevent embers from escaping 
                          and igniting nearby vegetation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Only Burn Appropriate Materials:</strong> Use dry, seasoned wood and avoid burning trash, 
                          leaves, or other materials that can produce flying embers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Never Leave the Fire Unattended:</strong> Always have someone monitoring the fire, and 
                          keep children and pets at a safe distance.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Keep Safety Supplies Nearby:</strong> Have a bucket of water, a garden hose, or a fire 
                          extinguisher close in case of an emergency.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Extinguish Thoroughly:</strong> When finished, douse the fire with water and stir the ashes 
                          to ensure everything is fully extinguished and cool to the touch.
                      </li>

                        Windy days significantly increase the risk of a fire spreading. Avoid using your firepit when high winds 
                        are forecasted. Always monitor the weather, and if conditions seem unsafe, wait for a calmer day.
